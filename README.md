# cms-gource

This repository contains configuration scripts, log files, and graphic assets
used to generate a source code repository visualization using [Gource](https://gource.io).

For more information on how to use [CMS.gov](https://cms.gov)'s collection of
APIs, datasets, frameworks, and style guides to develop applications that help
people get the services and benefits they rely on, visit
[developer.cms.gov](https://developer.cms.gov).

## Usage
1. install dependencies
2. create repos directory
3. clone repos
4. generate logs
5. insert names
6. colorize logs
7. Concatenate and sort logs
8. run gource 
9. export video

### Install Dependencies 

The author used the open source [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) project to install
the gource and ffmpeg tools on a Mac. 

    brew install gource
    brew install ffmpeg


Gource and ffmpeg can also be installed directly from source on
[GitHub.com](https://github.com/acaudwell/Gource) and
[ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#get-sources) or via most Linux
distribution package managers.

Author used standard commandline tools such as the [Vim text
editor](https://www.vim.org) to add hexadecimal color codes to the end of each
line in the log to colorize the output, and the [sed stream
editor](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/) to insert parent names into logs.
Most text manipulation tools capable of regular expressions or find-and-replace
functions should work to achieve the same results.

### Create repos directory

    mkdir repos 
    cd repos


### Clone Repos

    git clone https://github.com/CMSgov/ab2d.git
    git clone https://github.com/CMSgov/bcda-app.git
    git clone https://github.com/CMSgov/beneficiary-fhir-data.git
    git clone https://github.com/CMSgov/bluebutton-web-server.git
    git clone https://github.com/CMSgov/dpc-app.git
    git clone https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system.git


### Generate Logs

    gource --output-custom-log log1.txt repos/ab2d
    gource --output-custom-log log2.txt repos/bcda-app
    gource --output-custom-log log3.txt repos/beneficiary-fhir-data
    gource --output-custom-log log4.txt repos/bluebutton-web-server
    gource --output-custom-log log5.txt repos/dpc-app
    gource --output-custom-log log6.txt repos/design-system

### Insert Names

    sed -i -r -E "s#(.+)\|#\1|/ab2d#" log1.txt
    sed -i -r -E "s#(.+)\|#\1|/bcda#" log2.txt
    sed -i -r -E "s#(.+)\|#\1|/beneficiary-fhir-data#" log3.txt
    sed -i -r -E "s#(.+)\|#\1|/blue-button#" log4.txt
    sed -i -r -E "s#(.+)\|#\1|/dpc#" log5.txt
    sed -i -r -E "s#(.+)\|#\1|/design-system#" log6.txt

### Colorize Logs (using vim)

    vim log1.txt
    :%norm A|F0F0F0

    vim log2.txt
    :%norm A|136A5D

    ...


### Concatenate and Sort Logs

    APIs only
    cat log1.txt log2.txt log3.txt log4.txt log5.txt | sort -n > cmsapis.log

    APIs + design-system
    cat log1.txt log2.txt log3.txt log4.txt log5.txt log6.txt | sort -n > cmsapis-plusdesign.log

    APIs + QPP quality tools
    cat log1.txt log2.txt log3.txt log4.txt log5.txt log7.txt log8.txt | sort -n > cmsapis-plusqpp.log



### Run Gource Visualization

    APIs Only
    time gource --load-config cms.conf -f -1920x1080 cmsapis.log 

    API + design-system
    time gource --load-config cms.conf -f -1920x1080 cmsapis-plusdesign.log 

(last output: 131.51s user 6.60s system 33% cpu 6:51.33 total)

### Export Video (.webm or .mp4)

    gource --load-config cms.conf -1920x1080 cmsapis.log -f -o - | ffmpeg -y -r 60 -f image2pipe -vcodec ppm -i - -vcodec libvpx -b 10000K cms-gource.webm
